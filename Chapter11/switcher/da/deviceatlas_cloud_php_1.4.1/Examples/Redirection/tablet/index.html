            This is the layout of our sample site intended for tablet mobile
            computers!

          <p>
            You have been redirected to this page because you are using a tablet
            mobile computer device.

        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <h2>See</h2>

            <strong>/Examples/Redirection/index.php</strong>

            All requests first go to this controller script. This script uses 
            DeviceAtlas to detect device type and decides which website to
            redirect to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>/Examples/Redirection/tablet/</strong>
            <br/>
            The files of this page are located in this directory.

        <div class="row">
          <h2>How does it work</h2>
          <p>
            If we have different web sites and each one is created to give the best
            content and user experience to a specific device type. Users will enter our
            main web-site URL in their browsers, the source code which gets this first
            request will use DeviceAtlas DeviceApi to detect the device type, then based
            on the conclusions, the user will be redirected to the web-site which provides
            the best experience for her/his device.</br>
            In this example four directories will mimic four different websites that give
            specific service to "desktop browsers", "mobile device" and "tablet pcs". Each
            directory contains a sample "index.html".
          </p>

          <h2>Files used in this example</h2>
          <p>
            In this example there are four directories representing four websites.
            The requests are redirected to one of this directories:
