    <h1>High-end Mobile Device Experience</h1>
    <div class="row">

      <p>
        This is the layout of our sample site intended for high-end mobile devices!
      </p>
      <p>
        You have been redirected to this page because you are using a highend
        mobile device with a browser that is able to show HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>See</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>/Examples/Redirection/index.php</strong>
        <br/>
        All requests first go to this controller script. This script uses 
        DeviceAtlas to detect device type and decides which website to
        redirect to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>/Examples/Redirection/mobile/highend/</strong>
        <br/>
        The files of this page are located in this directory.
      </p>

      <h2>How does it work</h2>
      <p>
        If we have different web sites and each one is created to give the best
        content and user experience to a specific device type. Users will enter our
        main web-site URL in their browsers, the source code which gets this first
        request will use DeviceAtlas DeviceApi to detect the device type, then based
        on the conclusions, the user will be redirected to the web-site which provides
        the best experience for her/his device.</br>
        In this example four directories will mimic four different websites that give
        specific service to "desktop browsers", "mobile device" and "tablet pcs". Each
        directory contains a sample "index.html".
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example there are four directories representing four websites.
        The requests are redirected to one of this directories:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Landing page:</strong><br/>
        <span>/Examples/Redirection/index.php</span><br/>
        <strong>Desktop computer browsers:</strong><br/>
        <span>/Examples/Redirection/desktop/index.html</span><br/>
        <strong>Tablet mobile computers:</strong><br/>
        <span>/Examples/Redirection/tablet/index.html</span><br/>
        <strong>High-end mobile devices:</strong><br/>
        <span>/Examples/Redirection/mobile/highend/index.html</span><br/>
        <strong>Low-end mobile devices:</strong><br/>
        <span>/Examples/Redirection/mobile/lowend/index.html</span><br/>
