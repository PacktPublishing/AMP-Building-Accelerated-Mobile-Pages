# DeviceAtlas Client-side Component #

DeviceAtlas provides an optional client-side JavaScript library for gathering
additional properties using Javascript. This library can send the gathered
properties back to the DeviceAtlas API running on a web server. The JavaScript
properties are then used to augment the regular DeviceAtlas properties and allow
for additional capabilities like fine-grained Apple device detection.

The client properties are also available to other JavaScript libraries. The
DeviceAtlas client detection file needs to be included on your web page for
this to function. Full documentation and example code is included in the
API packages.


## Introduction ##

DeviceAtlas uses HTTP headers to accurately identify devices. This is achieved
by passing the headers to a server-side DeviceAtlas API. The API then uses the
headers to determine the correct set of properties for the request. These
properties are then returned to the calling application.

This approach is suitable for the vast majority of cases except for two
situations:

1. Apple Devices: The data passed from Apple devices in the HTTP headers does
not contain any information to indicate which specific model is accessing the
server. It only shows if it is an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch but not, for
example, if its an iPhone 4 or an iPhone 7. This is a large problem if device
specific data is required for these devices. Client-side data can be used to
augment the server-side DeviceAtlas data to more accurately identify Apple
devices.

2. Contextual information: Client-side data can help indicate the current
context of the user/device such as the current device orientation of the device
or if the user has cookies enabled. It can also improve the server-side
property set for JavaScript and HTML5 properties for less well-known browsers.


## Client-side Component ##

The DeviceAtlas client-side component is a small JavaScript library that can
be included on a webpage. The library gathers client-side properties and
optionally creates a cookie containing the data. The cookie is used as a means
of transferring the client-side data to the server but alternative approaches
can be used such as sending the data in an Ajax request. The client-side data
sent to the server must then be passed to the DeviceAtlas API along with the
device HTTP headers. The API will use the HTTP headers and the client-side
properties to detect Apple Devices. The resulting property set contains the
merged server and client side properties.


### Client-side Access to Properties ###

The properties gathered by the client-side component are available to other
JavaScript functions and can be accessed on the client-side by using the
"DeviceAtlas" namespace.

**Example:**

```JavaScript
// Does the browser support Web GL ?
var supportsWebGl = DeviceAtlas.js.webGl;
```

The normal DeviceAtlas property name should be used to access the client-side
property. A full list of the client side properties can be found on the
[DeviceAtlas website](https://deviceatlas.com/resources/client-side-properties).


### Server-side Access to Properties ###

The client-side component creates a special cookie with the detected client
properties. This cookie is used as a way to transmit the properties back to
the server. Other approaches such as AJAX could also be used. The usage of the
properties via the cookie is different in the Enterprise and Cloud APIs.

By default, the cookie containing the properties is called "DAPROPS".

#### Use with Enterprise API ####

If the cookie is available and the DeviceApiWeb extension is used, the API will
automatically use the cookie contents as a part of the detection. However it is
also possible to pass the client-side properties manually to the APIs. Please
refer to the technical API development documentation for details.

Apache / NGINX / IIS web server modules handle the cookie automatically.

** Compatibility requirements **

For correct functionality an up-to-date JSON file and the following Enterprise
API versions are required.

- Java: 1.6 or later
- Node.js: 2.1 or later
- PHP: 1.6 or later
- .NET: 1.6 or later
- Python: 1.6 or later
- Ruby: 1.6 or later
- C++: 2.1.2 or later
- C: 2.1.2 or later

#### Use with Cloud API ####

If the cookie is available and the API is configured to use the cookie, the API
will automatically forward the cookie contents to the Cloud service and will be
used as a part of the detection. Please refer to the technical API development
documentation for details.

** Compatibility requirements **

For correct functionality the Cloud API 1.3 version or later is required.

### Basic Server-side Usage ###

1. Include the deviceatlas-X.X.min.js file on a web page.
2. In the server-side web application, pass the contents of the DeviceAtlas
   cookie to the DeviceAtlas API.

NOTE: the cookie contents will only be set **after** the first request. It is
recommended to not rely on the client-side properties for the very first page
load.

Please see the Example code bundled with the API for more information.

### Custom Configuration ###

To customise the cookie name or other cookie parameters like domain or a path
you can use the configuration code below - this code must be included before the
deviceatlas-X.X.min.js file.

```JavaScript
<script type="text/JavaScript">
var DeviceAtlas = {
    cookieName: 'DAPROPS',           // the cookie name
    cookieExpiryDays: 1,             // the time the cookie expires in days
    cookieDomain: '.yourdomain.tld', // custom domain
    cookiePath: '/',                 // custom path
    debug: false                     // expects bool|function - default false, pass true to use console.log or pass any callback function
}
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./deviceatlas-X.X.min.js"></script>
```

### Sending client-side data via URL ###

In a restricted environment where cookies are not allowed it is possible to get
the client-side data using the JavaScript getPropertiesAsString() method and
pass it as a URL parameter.

NOTE: When integrating with a web application, the value should be fetched from
the URL and passed to the DeviceAtlas API.

**Example:**

```JavaScript
<script type="text/JavaScript">

window.onload = function() {
    var img = document.createElement('img');
    img.setAttribute('id', 'ad-banner');
    img.setAttribute('src', './ads.php?DAPROPS=' +
        encodeURIComponent(DeviceAtlas.getPropertiesAsString()));
    document.body.appendChild(img);
}

</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./deviceatlas-X.X.min.js"></script>
```

### Identification of Apple devices ###

The DeviceAtlas Client-side Component augments the server side properties and
allows for accurate identification of Apple devices. The following variants of
iPhone and iPad models are identified. Please note there is a small selection
of older devices that cannot be identified fully. In this case, all of the
possible model names are returned.

| Apple device | Without client-side | With client-side 1.5 |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| iPhone | iPhone | iPhone/iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS |
| iPhone 3G | iPhone | iPhone/iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS |
| iPhone 3GS | iPhone | iPhone/iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS |
| iPhone 4 | iPhone | iPhone 4 |
| iPhone 4S | iPhone | iPhone 4S |
| iPhone 5 | iPhone | iPhone 5/iPhone 5C |

### Adding device properties ###

The capabilities of the Client-side component can be customised by adding or
replacing functions to detect device properties.

**Example:**

```JavaScript

<script type="text/javascript">

/**
 * Adding property to see if its a modern browser:
 *
 * For more details: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
 */
var DeviceAtlas = {
    properties: {
        isModernBrowser: function() {
            return DeviceAtlas.cookieSupport &&
                DeviceAtlas.js.webWorkers &&
                DeviceAtlas.js.webSockets &&
                DeviceAtlas.css.animations &&
                DeviceAtlas.html.video &&
                DeviceAtlas.html.svg &&
                DeviceAtlas.js.webGl &&
                DeviceAtlas.js.localStorage;
        }
    }
}

</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./deviceatlas-X.X.min.js"></script>
```

### Client-side Component Variants ###

#### Standard Library ####

The standard version of the Client-side Component is distributed in the
deviceatlas-x.x.min.js file.

It provides the detection of
[the full property set](https://deviceatlas.com/resources/client-side-properties).

#### Lite Variant ####

The Lite variant, a subset of the standard component for optimisation purposes,
is distributed in the deviceatlas-lite-x.x.min.js file.

It solely identifies those device properties that are required to distinguish
the underlying hardware of iOS based devices.

#### Custom Build ####

From the DeviceAtlas site, a customised Client-side component with a subset of
properties can be created tailored to specific needs.

The resulting JavaScript file will be optimised in terms of size and speed to
improve end-user experience.

Please see the [DeviceAtlas Client-side Component generator](https://deviceatlas.com/resources/clientside).
